# Autonomous Project Team System

> **A revolutionary Goose-based system for fully autonomous project execution using specialized AI subagents**

## 🚀 Overview

The Autonomous Project Team system is a sophisticated framework that takes high-level project goals and autonomously designs, orchestrates, and executes complete projects to completion. Using specialized AI subagents, it can handle everything from requirements analysis to deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Orchestration**: Meta-AI coordinator that analyzes project goals and determines optimal team composition
- **👥 Specialized Subagents**: 7 expert AI agents handling different aspects of development
- **⚡ Parallel Execution**: Smart workflow management with parallel and sequential task execution
- **📊 Structured Output**: Comprehensive JSON outputs with quality metrics and progress tracking
- **🔧 MCP Integration**: Leverages powerful MCP servers for extended capabilities
- **📚 Complete Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation, tests, and deployment configs

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Project Goal → Main Orchestrator → Specialized Subagents → Complete Project
```

### Specialized Subagents

1. **🔍 Project Researcher** - Requirements analysis and technology research
2. **📋 Task Manager** - Project decomposition and execution planning
3. **💻 Code Developer** - Implementation following best practices
4. **🔍 Code Reviewer** - Quality assurance and security review
5. **📖 Documentation Writer** - Comprehensive documentation creation
6. **🧪 QA Specialist** - Testing and quality validation
7. **🚀 Deployment Specialist** - Production deployment and CI/CD

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Run the auto-installer
./install-autonomous-team.sh
```

### 2. Configuration

```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### 3. Run Your First Project

```bash
goose run --recipe autonomous-project-team.yaml \
  --params project_goal="Create a task management web app with React and Node.js"
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Goose AI framework
- Node.js and npm
- API keys for AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

## 🎯 Example Projects

### Web Application
```bash
goose run --recipe autonomous-project-team.yaml \
  --params project_goal="Build a responsive e-commerce website with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment integration"
```

### REST API
```bash
goose run --recipe autonomous-project-team.yaml \
  --params project_goal="Create a RESTful API for a blog platform with user management, posts, comments, and authentication"
```

### Data Analysis Tool
```bash
goose run --recipe autonomous-project-team.yaml \
  --params project_goal="Develop a Python tool for CSV data analysis with statistical computations and visualization"
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `project_goal` | High-level project description | Any text |
| `execution_mode` | How tasks are executed | `auto`, `sequential`, `parallel` |
| `team_size` | Number of subagents to use | `minimal`, `optimal`, `comprehensive` |
| `project_complexity` | Expected complexity level | `simple`, `medium`, `complex`, `auto-detect` |
| `output_directory` | Where to store outputs | Any valid path |

## 📊 Expected Deliverables

For each project, the system typically delivers:

- ✅ **Complete Implementation** - Fully functional code
- ✅ **Comprehensive Tests** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- ✅ **Documentation** - README, API docs, user guides
- ✅ **Quality Reports** - Code review, security analysis, performance metrics
- ✅ **Deployment Configuration** - Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure setup
- ✅ **Project Analysis** - Requirements, architecture, risk assessment

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Dynamic Team Composition
The system intelligently selects which subagents to use based on project requirements.

### Parallel Processing
Independent tasks execute simultaneously for faster completion.

### Structured Output
All results are provided in structured JSON format for easy integration.

### Memory Management
Persistent context and learning across project executions.
